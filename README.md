# crystal-libraries-needed

Please create issues for the features you need or want from CrystalLang, label them appropriately and let me know if you have any thoughts on the management of this list.

If you want to attack one of the issues, let me know and i'll "assign" it to you, and include a link to your repo

Cheers John
